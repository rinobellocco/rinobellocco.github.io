An introduction to R, Rmarkdown, and Shiny
========

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Last update: December 6, 2019

Time and location: December 9, 10.00-11.30  
Paul Blomqvist room, Eugeniahemmet, T2:02, Karolinska University Hospital  
Solna

## KEP coding club:  

The presentation is divided in two parts:  

|  |    |  
|--|----|  
| ![](https://github.com/rstudio/hex-stickers/raw/master/PNG/rmarkdown.png){width=200px} |  **1. An introduction to R in markdown** <br>  The aim of the first part is to give a user-friendly introduction to [R]( https://www.r-project.org/) in [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/). The code and results will be displayed in a fully reproducible document using [R Markdown]( https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). <br><br> Rmarkdown lets you insert R code into a markdown document. R then generates a final document, in a wide variety of formats, that replaces the R code with its results. <br> [Project Site Link >](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)|

|--|----|  
| ![](https://github.com/rstudio/hex-stickers/raw/master/PNG/shiny.png){width=200px} |  **2. A working example of building an interactive Shiny app** <br> In the second part, I will show how to build a interactive app in [Shiny]( https://shiny.rstudio.com/) starting by a static code analysis. This will be based on a working example on how to present incidence and mortality rates of Prostate Cancer in Sweden over time. <br><br> Shiny makes it incredibly easy to build interactive web applications with R. Shiny has automatic “reactive” binding between inputs and outputs and extensive pre-built widgets. <br> [Project Site Link >](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)|
