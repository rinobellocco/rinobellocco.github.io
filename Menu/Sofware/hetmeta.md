The hetmeta R package: Heterogeneity Measures in Meta-Analysis
========

The `hetmeta` package is a free and open-source add-on for quantifying the impact of heterogeneity in meta-analysis within the statistical software environment [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
You can install the package (or upgrade to the newest version) from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hetmeta/index.html) directly within R by typing:

`install.packages(“hetmeta”)`

A development version is hosted and avaiable on [GitHub](https://github.com/alecri/dosresmeta) by typing:

`install.packages("devtools")`

`devtools::install_github("alecri/hetmeta”)`
